## Branching Strategy

### Primary Branches

#### `main` Branch
- **Purpose**: Production-ready, stable code
- **Protection**: All changes require pull requests
- **Deployment**: Source for releases and distributions
- **Merge Policy**: Only from feature branches via reviewed PRs

#### Active Development Branches

1. **`build_exe`** - Executable build system development
   - Focus: PyInstaller configuration and native executable creation
   - Recent Activity: Windows/Linux executable builds
   - Status: Merged to main via PR #19 and #20

2. **`context_awareness_RL`** - AI context awareness improvements  
   - Focus: Enhanced agent memory and context management
   - Status: Currently active development branch

3. **`modal_ollama_deployment`** - Alternative deployment option
   - Focus: Ollama integration for local LLM deployment
   - Purpose: Reduce dependency on OpenAI API

4. **`test_agent`** - Agent testing and experimentation
   - Focus: Agent behavior testing and improvements
   - Purpose: Safe environment for agent modifications

5. **`UIChanges`** - Frontend user interface improvements
   - Focus: React component updates and styling
   - Status: Merged improvements to main

6. **`data_branch`** - Data collection and analysis features
   - Focus: Usage analytics and performance monitoring
   - Status: Merged via PR #18

### Commit Quality Assessment

#### âœ… Good Practices Observed
- **Merge Commits**: Proper use of merge commits for feature integration
- **Pull Request Integration**: Systematic use of PRs for code review
- **Branch Management**: Clear separation of features into dedicated branches
- **Progressive Development**: Iterative improvements with logical progression

#### ðŸ”„ Areas for Improvement
- **Commit Messages**: Some messages could be more descriptive
  - Current: "Structure changes"
  - Better: "Refactor project structure for better modularity"
- **Conventional Commits**: Consider adopting conventional commit format
  - Example: `feat(agent): add context awareness for improved responses`

## Workflow Process

### Feature Development Workflow

1. **Branch Creation**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name
   ```

2. **Development and Commits**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "descriptive commit message"
   ```

3. **Push to Remote**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/new-feature-name
   ```

4. **Pull Request Creation**
   - Create PR through GitHub interface
   - Request code review
   - Address feedback if needed

5. **Merge to Main**
   - Merge via GitHub after approval
   - Delete feature branch after merge

### Release Process

1. **Executable Builds**
   - Built from `build_exe` branch
   - Windows and Linux versions created
   - Moved to `/build` directory for distribution

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - README.md updates with each major release
   - Version information maintained

---

## Branch-Specific Development Guidelines

### For `build_exe` Branch
- **Focus**: Executable packaging and distribution
- **Testing Required**: Multi-platform testing (Windows/Linux)
- **Dependencies**: PyInstaller configuration updates
- **Deployment**: Copy built executables to `/build` directory

### For `context_awareness_RL` Branch  
- **Focus**: AI agent improvements
- **Testing Required**: Agent behavior validation
- **Dependencies**: LangChain/LangGraph updates
- **Integration**: Requires testing with existing agent workflows

### For `modal_ollama_deployment` Branch
- **Focus**: Alternative deployment platform
- **Testing Required**: Modal cloud deployment validation
- **Dependencies**: Modal CLI and Ollama integration
- **Documentation**: Update deployment guides

### For UI Development Branches
- **Focus**: Frontend improvements
- **Testing Required**: Cross-browser compatibility
- **Dependencies**: React/TypeScript updates
- **Build Process**: `npm run build` required before merge

---

## Code Review Standards

### Pull Request Requirements
- **Description**: Clear description of changes and motivation
- **Testing**: Evidence of testing (manual or automated)
- **Documentation**: Updated documentation if applicable
- **Conflicts**: Resolved merge conflicts before review

### Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows project conventions
- [ ] No obvious security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Breaking changes documented
- [ ] Tests pass (when available)

---

## Release Management

### Version Control
- **Main Branch**: Always deployable
- **Feature Branches**: Individual feature development
- **Hotfix Process**: Direct fixes to main for critical issues

### Build Process
1. **Development**: Feature branches \u2192 main via PR
2. **Building**: `build_exe` branch for executable creation
3. **Distribution**: Built executables moved to `/build`
4. **Documentation**: Update README and changelogs

### Deployment Targets
- **Local Executable**: Windows/Linux native applications
- **Modal Cloud**: Serverless cloud deployment
- **Development**: Local development environment
